## What It Does
SBC (Sports Betting Companion) analyzes World Cup 2026 matches to identify value betting opportunities by comparing fair odds against sportsbook lines. The platform displays upcoming fixtures, calculates expected value (EV) and edge percentages, and provides a chatbot interface for querying betting information. Users can quickly scan high-value bets across different markets including moneylines, handicaps, totals, and prop bets.

## Setup
- npm install
- npm run dev

## Mock Data
Our app uses mock data for World Cup 2026 fixtures, betting lines, and value calculations. The odds, edge percentages, and EV metrics are illustrative examples based on typical sports betting scenarios. Next week we'll connect it to our backend APIs for real-time odds feeds and live model predictions.
